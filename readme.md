# Guessing game
<b>Made for university's UI course</b>

This is a guessing game, where program generates closed cards and user has to open and match them. User can select name, difficulty. Leaderbord is also shown, which is saved in session storage to keep track of best scores.

### What have I learned

1. **Session storage**
   - First time using and working with it.

2. **Javascript classes and objects**
   - Got more experience with OOP and the way javascript handles it.

3. **A little bit more of HTML/CSS**
   - More experience in this area.

### How to use it
Save project into desired folder and just open index.html file in browser
